# Simulating EDR with LimaCharlie Victim-Attacker VMs and Sliver-C2 Framework

I have worked on a home lab and simulated Endpoint Detection and
Response(EDR) system which consists of a Windows 10 virtual(VM) machine, Active Directory Domain Controller, and Linux attacker VM, and LimaCharlie with EDR-like ability. Installed a Sysmon (windows sysinternal tool) for more verbose log telemetry, and LimaCharlie sensors on the Windows 10, and AD-DC
machine that collects and analyzes log files and, Elastic SIEM for centralized log analysis after simulating attacks using Sliver C2 a
command and control framework, created detection rules leveraging the Sigma rule to identify and block abnormal activities. Fine-tuned the detection rules to minimize false positives, enhancing the system’s threat detection and prevention capabilities.


## Lab Components

- Victim VM: Windows 10, and AD-DC with LimaCharlie Sensors 
- Attacker VM: Linux (Kali/Ubuntu) running Sliver C2 Framework
- EDR Platform: [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io/)
- SIEM Platform:Elastic 
- Detection Logic: Custom Sigma rules

## Attack Simulation

Used [Sliver C2](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) to simulate attacks like:
- Reverse shell
- File exfiltration
- Persistence mechanisms
- Privilege escalation
- Unauthorized access to the lsass.exe memory for credential harvesting

## Detection & Response

- Created Sigma rules to detect suspicious behavior
- Fine-tuned rules to reduce false positives
- Leveraged LimaCharlie’s capabilities to isolate/seal the system in response to the suspicious behavior generated by the SIEM threat detection dashboard.
